# F1 GraphQL API Prototype

This API is a GraphQL implementation of the excellent [Ergast F1 REST API](http://ergast.com/mrd/)

It is a prototype for testing/POC purposes and does not interact with the Ergast data (a MongoDB image of the data is required).

It uses the following technologies:

- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- GraphQL
- MongoDB
- Mongoose ORM
- GraphQL Tools (for GQL code splitting/parsing)
